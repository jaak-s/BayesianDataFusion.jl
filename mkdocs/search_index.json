The side information contains basic features about users like age group and gender and genre information for movies. To run the example first install Julia library for reading matlab files\n\n\nPkg.add(\nMAT\n)\n\n\n\n\nExample code\n\n\nusing BayesianDataFusion\nusing MAT\n## load and setup data\npkgdir = Pkg.dir(\nBayesianDataFusion\n)\ndata   = matread(\n$pkgdir/data/movielens_1m.mat\n)\n\n## setup entities, assigning side information through optional argument F\nusers  = Entity(\nusers\n,  F=data[\nFu\n]);\nmovies = Entity(\nmovies\n, F=data[\nFv\n]);\n\n## setup the relation between users and movies, data from sparse matrix data[\nX\n]\n## first element in '[users, movies]' corresponds to rows and second to columns of data[\nX\n]\nratings = Relation(data[\nX\n], \nratings\n, [users, movies], class_cut = 2.5);\n\n## assign 500,000 of the observed ratings randomly to the test set\nassignToTest!(ratings, 500_000)\n\n## precision of the ratings to 1.5 (i.e., variance of 1/1.5)\nsetPrecision!(ratings, 1.5)\n\n## the model (with only one relation)\nRD = RelationData(ratings)\n\n## run Gibbs sampler of Macau with 10 latent dimensions, total of 100 burnin and 400 posterior samples\nresult = macau(RD, burnin=100, psamples=400, clamp=[1.0, 5.0], num_latent=10)\n\n\n\n\nThis model has only a single relation \nratings\n between entities \nusers\n and \nmovies\n.\nWe use precision 1.5, which is known to be a good estimate of movie rating noise.\nThe optional parameter \nclamp=[1.0, 5.0]\n to \nmacau\n thresholds the predictions to be between 1.0 and 5.0.\nTo build a model with larger latent dimension use, for example, \nnum_latent=30\n.\n\n\nMacau output shows the progress of the Gibbs sampler:\n\n\n  1: Acc=0.836 ROC=0.500 RMSE=1.118 | use[U:  3.1 \u03b2:0.04 \u03bb=21.] mov[U:  3.1 \u03b2:0.07 \u03bb=10.] | rati[\u03b1=1.5] [4s]\n  2: Acc=0.836 ROC=0.500 RMSE=1.118 | use[U:  4.4 \u03b2:0.03 \u03bb=60.] mov[U:  4.4 \u03b2:0.04 \u03bb=38.] | rati[\u03b1=1.5] [0s]\n...\n 80: Acc=0.864 ROC=0.829 RMSE=0.889 | use[U: 72.7 \u03b2:1.34 \u03bb=4.5] mov[U:122.6 \u03b2:3.25 \u03bb=3.1] | rati[\u03b1=1.5] [0s]\n 81: Acc=0.864 ROC=0.829 RMSE=0.888 | use[U: 73.0 \u03b2:1.39 \u03bb=5.3] mov[U:123.0 \u03b2:3.32 \u03bb=3.2] | rati[\u03b1=1.5] [0s]\n...\n\n\n\n\nThe Acc/ROC/RMSE are computed on the test ratings. Note the optional argument \nclass_cut = 2.5\n, used for creating a \nRelation\n, defines the class boundary for computing accuracy (Acc) and AUC-ROC (ROC) values. \n\n\nAn example result of the run is:\n\n\nDict{AbstractString,Any} with 10 entries:\n  \nlatent_multi_threading\n =\n true\n  \npsamples\n               =\n 400\n  \nlambda_beta\n            =\n 14.506891192240246\n  \nRMSE\n                   =\n 0.8526296036293598\n  \ntrain_counts\n           =\n 500000x2 DataFrames.DataFrame\u2026\n  \npredictions\n            =\n 500000x5 DataFrames.DataFrame\u2026\n  \nburnin\n                 =\n 100\n  \nnum_latent\n             =\n 10\n  \naccuracy\n               =\n 0.870428\n  \nROC\n                    =\n 0.8485116969174835\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nresult[\"predictions\"]\n gives predicted values and their standard deviation for the values in the test set. The \nresult\n also contains ROC, RMSE and accuracy values for the test set.\n\n\nMovieLens w/o side-information\n\n\nThe above example used user and move features. You can easily factorize the ratings without them, which would correspond to classic \nBPMF\n method. Here is an example code\n\n\nusing BayesianDataFusion\nusing MAT\n## load and setup data\npkgdir = Pkg.dir(\nBayesianDataFusion\n)\ndata   = matread(\n$pkgdir/data/movielens_1m.mat\n)\n\n## setup entities, no features (F):\nusers  = Entity(\nusers\n);\nmovies = Entity(\nmovies\n);\n\n## setup the relation between users and movies, data from sparse matrix data[\nX\n]\n## first element in '[users, movies]' corresponds to rows and second to columns of data[\nX\n]\nratings = Relation(data[\nX\n], \nratings\n, [users, movies], class_cut = 2.5);\n\n## assign 500,000 of the observed ratings randomly to the test set\nassignToTest!(ratings, 500_000)\n\n## precision of the ratings to 1.5 (i.e., variance of 1/1.5)\nsetPrecision!(ratings, 1.5)\n\n## the model (with only one relation)\nRD = RelationData(ratings)\n\n## run Gibbs sampler of Macau with 10 latent dimensions, total of 100 burnin and 400 posterior samples\nresult = macau(RD, burnin=100, psamples=400, clamp=[1.0, 5.0], num_latent=10)\n\n\n\n\nIn most applications the performance of pure BPMF is weaker compared to Macau. This is also true in the case of MovieLens dataset.\n\n\nSaving latent vectors\n\n\nTo save the sampled latent variables to disk macau has \noutput\n parameter. If it is set to non-empty string \nmacau\n saves all posterior latent variable matrices and uses the \noutput\n value as a prefix for the file names. The prefix can also include the path, for example\n\n\nresult = macau(RD, output = \n/home/user/mylatent\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhich will save the files as \n/home/user/mylatent-...\n.\nEvery sampled latent matrix of every entity will be saved as a separate file, stored by default in CSV format. There is also an option to save the output in binary 32bit floats (which will reduce the space required by 2x). This can be enabled by using \noutput_type=\"binary\"\n.\n\n\nTo save the files using prefix \nmylatent\n into the current working directory use \noutput = \"mylatent\"\n.\n\n\nReading latent matrix files\n\n\nThe saved CSV files can be read by the standard \nreaddlm\n function\n\n\nU1 = readdlm(\nmylatent-entity1-01.csv\n, ',')\n\n\n\n\nwhere \"01\" is the sample number that takes values from \"01\" (or \"001\") to \npsamples\n.\n\n\nIf the \noutput_type=\"binary\"\n was used, the written files can be read by using the function \nread_binary_float32\n, for example\n\n\nusing BayesianDataFusion\nU1 = read_binary_float32(\nmylatent-entity1-01.binary\n)\n\n\n\n\nSaving link matrix (beta)\n\n\nFor the models that have features the sampled link matrices \nbeta\n can be saved by setting both \noutput\n to a prefix and \noutput_beta = true\n. For example:\n\n\nresult = macau(RD, output = \n/home/user/mylatent\n, output_beta = true)\n\n\n\n\nThe beta matrices can be read similarly to the latent matrix files as described above, using either \nreaddlm\n for CSV files and \nread_binary_float32\n for binary files.\n\n\nEfficient storage of sparse matrices\n\n\nThe package also includes functions for writing and reading binary format for \nsparse matrix\n.\n\n\n## random sparse matrix\nX = sprand(100, 50, 0.1)\nwrite_sparse_float32(\nX.sparse\n, X)\n\n## reading back the rows, cols and values from the file\nI, J, V = read_sparse_float32(\nX.sparse\n)\nX2 = sparse(I, J, V)",
